Hi {{.Name}},

Your activation code is: {{.ActivationCode}}.
Use it in terminal to finalize your Mantil registration:

    mantil activate {{.ActivationCode}}

If you havenâ€™t already you will need to install Mantil CLI first. You can do it over Homebrew: 

    brew tap mantil-io/mantil
    brew install mantil

or with direct download. Check Installation documentation at https://github.com/mantil-io/docs#installation for detailed instructions.
