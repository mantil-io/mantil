Hi {{.Name}},

Your activation token is: {{.Token}}.
Use it in the terminal to finalize your Mantil registration:

mantil user activate {{.Token}}

If you haven’t already you will need to install Mantil CLI first. You can do it over Homebrew: 
    brew tap mantil-io/mantil
    brew install mantil
or with direct download. Detailed instructions are available at https://github.com/mantil-io/docs.
