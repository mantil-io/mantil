# Support

Mantil is in early beta, and we are continuously improving it. If you need help or want to share your feedback, email us at [support@mantil.com](mailto:support@mantil.com?subject=Mantil%20feedback) or join our [Slack Community](https://join.slack.com/t/mantilcommunity/shared_invite/zt-z3iy0lsn-7zD_6nqEucsgygTvHmnxAw).

# Troubleshooting

## Bug report

If you experience any issue with Mantil, you can tell us a little bit more about it with
```
mantil report
``` 
This command will send the last three days of logs that will help us analyze the reported problem. 

## Application logs

You can also check application logs by yourself. Depending on your OS, here is where you can find those. 

### macOS

Use Finder application:

* Click Shift (⇧) + Command Key (⌘) + G;
* To locate the Mantil application logs folder, write this path ~/Library/Application Support/Mantil/logs and click Go:


### Linux

```
~/.config/Mantil/logs
```


### Windows

C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\logs

* Press Win Key + R
* Write down appdata into the field and click OK
* Go to Roaming > Mantil > logs

There, you will find the Mantil application logs folder.
